This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent developed using Python and the Minimax algorithm.
The AI makes optimal decisions, making it unbeatable when played correctly.

This project was completed as part of Week 1 of the WeIntern Internship to understand the fundamentals of Artificial
Intelligence, game logic, and decision-making algorithms.

--What is Minimax?
The Minimax algorithm is a recursive decision-making algorithm used in two-player games.
The AI tries to maximize its score
The human player tries to minimize the AI’s score
The algorithm explores all possible game states to choose the best move

--Features
>Human vs AI gameplay

>Tracks Player wins, AI wins, and Draws
>Clear and interactive Command Line Interface (CLI)
>Input validation for better user experience
>Modular and readable Python code

--Tech Stack
>Language: Python
>Algorithm: Minimax
>Interface: Command Line (CLI)
